## Overview of Statistical Analysis
 - For this project we focused on a weather analysis of Oahu, Hawaii to determine if openeing a surf and Ice cream shop would flourish as a possible buisness in this area. The analysis was prompted by a buisness partner who has experience in the field and wanted to be sure that the weather in Oahu would be condusive in allowing a buisness like this to flourish and be successful. Int eh module work we were abel to provide data that supported our benture in that for most of the days throughout the year the weather was sunny and warm. You can see the data that supports this information in the images provided below that detail descriptive analytics to the precipitaion amounts for the year of 2017 in Oahu, Hawaii. Along with a graph that plots the number of days throughout the year that the temperature was within a range of 60 to 85 degrees Fareinheight(climate_analysis.ipynb).

- As for the second part of our analysis, we were tasked with digging deeper in to the weater Data we were provided for Oahu, Hawaii and providing an analysis of the temperatures for the months of JUNE and DECEMBER. Where this differed from the module work ( referenced above) that foc=used ont he year 2017. The Challenge requested to aheva a deeper analysis of just JUNE and DECEMBER months throughout all the years of the procvided data which ranged from 2010 to 2017. So essentially we looked to provided statistical analysis for all the days in JUNE for that 7 year period and all the days in DECEMBER for that 7 year period to extract the descriptive figures (Count, Mean, Standard Deviation, Minimum, Maximum and Quartle ranges) for our analysis. Please refer tot he images of the summary statistics we generated for the months of JUNE and DECEMBER below (SurfsUP_Challenge).

## Results
- After reviewing the summary statistics generated for the two months referenced above we ahev listed a couple of takeaways from this data. 

1. These months are considered polar opposites in terms of seasons but comparitivly the temperature averages are not extremely different. The June Average tempeture according to our tables was ~75 Degrees (74.94). While the average temperature for DECEMBER was 71 degrees. there is a less than 4 degree diffreence in average temperature for these months which is ideal for a location being probed for a surf buisness. Meaning there is not n extreme amopunt of variance between the two months even though ttehy are on either ends of the spectrum (in terms of seasons)(SurfsUP_Challenge).

2. The same can be said regarding the Maximum temperatures recorded for JUNE and DECEMBER. Where the Max JUNE temperature ios 85.00 degrees, while the MAX temperature in DECEMBER was 83.00. Again this indicates that there is not a lot of variance in temperatures in that specific location. 

3. The main item to point our in terms of differing aspects would be the Minimum temperatures reported for JUNE and DECEMBER. There is a clear difference in these two numbers where the minimum tmperature recoreded in JUNE is 64.0 degrees and the Miniumum temperature in DECEMBER is 56.00 degrees. Based on the averages, this shouldnt be an issue i would assume becausse 56.00 degrees is well below the 25% quartile according to the tabe above. meaning this temperature (56) is likely to be pretty rare and possible reaching the area of an outlier. Where the Minimum temperature in JUNE is 64.00. What this does tell us is there is a slightly higher amount of temperature fluctuation in the month of DECEMBER as complared to JUNE. You can also see this in the STD section of the tables above, here the standard deviation for DECEMBER is 3.74 and 3.25 for JUNE, resepctivly. the Lowere percentiles in DECEMBER are decently lower than in JUNE as well which does indicate that there is a consistent temperature drop  for this month but the differences in temperatures between JUNE and DECEMBER seem to follow the same pattern. There is a range of about 3-5 degree difference between the quartile temperatureranges for the 2 months(SurfsUP_Challenge). 

4.Another itemto point out is that the Count of recorded temperatures for these month do differe. There are 1,700 recordings for the month of JUNE. While there are only 1,517 for the month of DECEMBER. I would say this sholdnt create and issues with our analyssis but with there being less recordings in the month of DECMEBER the summmary statistics could be slightly less acccurate(SurfsUP_Challenge). 


##Summary
-Based ont he information provided and extracted, i would suggest that Ohau, Hawaii si an ideal ocation to open a ice cream/ surf shop. it is safe to say that the temperatures, on average throughout the whole year will be above 70 degreee's and sunny. Even though i feel it is safe to come to that conclusion based off of this analysis, there are a couple of short comings to this reportand there may be some additional items to take in to consideration to further investigate the climate. 

  1. It would probably be best to re-run this abnalysis with the same data but adding the remaining recordings for DECEMNBER so that the recording Counts match at        1,700.00. this would allow us to have more accurate information and be able to compare the two months with less error(SurfsUP_Challenge).

  2. In addition to above, it might be best to take in to consideration other weather factors like wind specifically.  I have alimited understanding of Surfing, but wind may play a huge factor in generating waves for surfing or creating the ideal setting for surfing. A location that may nbe tioo windy to surf may not be ideal to open a surf shop. Taking in to consideration wind, just in General would be great. But then it would be even better to break it down further like we did the temperaturwes to determine which months are windier than others or if say December isis Windier than JUNE. Also it might be a good idea to dig deeper in to the precipitation numbers and determine which months out of the year are considered "rainier" than the others(SurfsUP_Challenge).
